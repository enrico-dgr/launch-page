START BOT: tg-instance goes to 'https://web.telegram.org/#/login' and clicks on bot chat link.
tg-instance writes '/visit'
ROUTINE: tg-instance finds the last button containing 'go to websites'. 
It takes the url from the button, parses it and opens a new page with that url. 
tg-instance waits for the new link button by taking always the last button and comparing 
the new url to the old one.
If the link is the same, tg-instance adds one to the counter.
If the link is new (different), tg-instance resets the counter.
If 'no ads' message shows up after repeated url, wait 60 seconds.
